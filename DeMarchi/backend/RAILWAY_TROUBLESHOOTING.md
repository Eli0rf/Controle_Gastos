# 🚨 RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT TROUBLESHOOTING

## Current Issue: "Healthcheck failure"

**PROGRESS: Service is now starting but health check is failing!** 

This means:
1. ✅ **Environment variables are now configured correctly**
2. ✅ **Dependencies are installing properly** 
3. ❌ **Health check endpoint `/health` is failing**
4. ❌ **Possible database connection issue**

## 🔍 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED

### Step 1: Check Railway Dashboard
1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Find your "controle-gastos-backend" service
3. Check the **Deployments** tab for errors
4. Look at **Logs** for startup errors

### Step 2: Verify Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in Railway:
```
JWT_SECRET=21032023
DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:KMTZNGtmtyCwdYXSydfKjgEvNCEvUKaN@yamanote.proxy.rlwy.net:14693/railway
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Make sure JWT_SECRET is exactly `21032023` in Railway dashboard!**
**🗄️ CRITICAL: Use the exact DATABASE_URL above with your Railway MySQL credentials!**

### Step 3: Check Health Check Issues
Look for these specific errors in Railway logs:
- ❌ "Database connection failed"
- ❌ "testConnection() failed"
- ❌ "Health check exception"
- ❌ "Cannot connect to MySQL"
- ❌ "ECONNREFUSED" or "ETIMEDOUT"

**🔍 Most likely issue: Database connection not working**

## 🛠️ SOLUTION OPTIONS

### Option A: Redeploy with Current Configuration
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click "Deploy" button
3. Wait for build to complete
4. Check logs for errors

### Option B: Use Dockerfile Deployment
1. In Railway dashboard → Settings → Deploy
2. Change build method to "Dockerfile"
3. Set Dockerfile path: `DeMarchi/backend/Dockerfile.railway`
4. Redeploy

### Option C: Emergency Manual Deployment
If all else fails, create a new Railway service:
1. Create new service in Railway
2. Connect to this Git repository
3. Set root directory: `/DeMarchi/backend`
4. Configure environment variables
5. Deploy

## 🔧 DEBUGGING COMMANDS

If you can access Railway console:
```bash
# Check if server is running
ps aux | grep node

# Check logs
cat /tmp/railway-*.log

# Test dependencies
node -e "require('express')"

# Run debug script
chmod +x debug.sh && ./debug.sh
```

## 📞 NEXT STEPS

1. **Check Railway logs immediately**
2. **Verify environment variables are set**
3. **Try redeployment**
4. **If still failing, switch to Dockerfile method**

## 🎯 Quick Test After Fix
Once redeployed, test:
- https://controlegastos-production.up.railway.app/health
- Should return JSON with server status
